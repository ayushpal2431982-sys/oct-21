# why React?
- We can use state which means that once we update the state variable, it changes across the page.
- We can split our app into multiple components and reuse those cpmponents.
- React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI which is better then updating content using Manipulation.
- Debuggingb and maintainance is easy.
